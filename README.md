# Prediction-of-Covid-19-Deaths-and-Cases-by-Method-of-Regression-Modeling
As part of the final project for Data 100. Principles and Techniques of Data Science course at UC Berkeley. 

**Collaborators: Shaye Hong, Ruqian Wang.**

This project aimed to map interesting findings from confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths reported in counties across the United States from January to mid-April. In particular, we attempted to apply regression models to predict cases and death rates in each of these counties. This analysis comes at an appropriate time as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread globally. Creating data-driven predictive models has the potential to provide estimates on how many people will be directly affected by this disease. Early prediction of Covid-19 could allow the government to effectively allocate funding, and allow hospitals to adequately prepare for the influx of new patients.
